First of all, I've never organized a conference. I did do [quite some presentations](https://www.avanderlee.com/presentations/) after which I've always been asked to give feedback to the conference.

I do have the experience of feedback from organizers making me realize it's a hard job, taking a lot of time. With that, I started this repository to sum up the best practices list as a reference for future conference organizers.

This is not ***the*** way to organize conferences, it's just a general list of inspiration to think of when organizing one.

As I'm not alone in this community, I would love to see contributions through PRs.

**Feel free to bring your ideas into this repository, to make the lives of the conference organizers a bit easier!**

# The stage
- **Provide a headset** so the speaker can present hands-free. A wireless microphone to be able to walk around should be the minimum.
- **Have some often used dongles** available to use with support for USB-C and thunderbolt.
- An **open stage** is preferred to make it possible to walk around
- **A clicker** is often forgotten by speakers, if you can have one you'll make some speakers happy!
- Make sure the **projector is sharp and readable** for all seats. Many presentations contain code examples, which are often already hard to read.

# Room hosting
- **Provide a host** to announce the speakers, even if it's only a very short "Here's Antoine telling you about.." You give the stage to the speaker and you give them a nice kick-start
- If you have multiple tracks, try to **close a track 10 minutes before the end**. It's quite distracting for the speaker if suddenly a lot of people enter the room as the other talk finished earlier.

# Timekeeping
- Use **time left signs** with the big numbers 5 and 10 representing minutes for speakers running out of time
- **Fix delays** by skipping questions or shorten breaks
- **Ending a conference at 6 pm** is preferable after starting around 9 am. A conference day can be long for both attendees and speakers.
- An **after party** is nice to have, but can be great for bonding between all attendees including speakers.

# Creating schedules
Is hard! A good way to prevent the big stage from being empty while the small one is packed is to ask the attendees which talks they will visit in advance. This can be done easily by using, for example, a Google Form.

An entertaining talk to end the day is preferable. Diving into a very technical topic by the end of a conference can be pretty tough for the attendees.

# Booking flights
- Make sure to **use the passport names of the speakers** to prevent costs for renaming or even boarding rejection as names are not correct.
- If speakers arrive at the same time, you can let them know so they can **share cabs**

# Sharing information to the speakers in advance
Many things seem to be common sense, but it's all about clarity here. Over communication can help a lot to save you from some common questions asked by speakers.

- The **resolution** of the projector. 16:9 is preferred, otherwise 4:3.
- The **available dongles** on stage
- **Preferred language** of the presentations, like English
- Are the talks **recorded**
- Is there a **comfort screen**?
- Is **Q&A** factored into the slot length?
- Can we use our **own laptop**?
- Can we use **audio and video**?
- Information on **speaker dinners**
- Information on **after parties**
- **Travel information** for going from the Airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the conference. Even if you don't provide rides, it's good to know that the speakers need to manage it themselves.
- **One or two phone numbers** to use for questions around the conference. Preferable with Whatsapp to make discussions happen async and not blocking for you.

### Hotel information
- Check in and check out times
- Which name is used for the booking
- Address of the hotel

# Sharing information when requesting a talk with a speaker

- Any information about the **audience**.
- Are they all developers?
- Are they mostly students or more experienced
- How many attendees will there be?
- How many attendees will there be in the room of the speaker?
- The required **length of the talk**
- The **location, date and venue** of the conference
- Any other **confirmed speakers** so far
- The **conference website**
